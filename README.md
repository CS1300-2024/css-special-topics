# css-special-topics
Though you'll learn how to use CSS well in this class, this livecode repo includes some CSS topics that we don't teach you in lectures or studios, notably how to use the CSS grid display.

Our goal is to give you some more exposure with CSS as a language beyond the very basics, as well as to teach you some tricks that can be helpful as you begin building hand-in sites (and your portfolio later on).

## Topics
- Grid
  - Line-based placement
  - Grid Areas
- Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
- Adding custom fonts
  - Importing fonts from the web
  - Importing local fonts from your computer

## How to Use This Repository
This repository contains the livecode written during the 2/13 special topics office hours session. You can clone this repo and run the `index.html` file to see the site created during the livecode, and you can edit any and all of the website's styling via the `styles.css` file. 

NB: `fonts/` doesn't have the font files that were used during the hours session, but feel free to add your own font files to play around with importing local fonts!
